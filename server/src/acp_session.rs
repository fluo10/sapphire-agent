//! The ACP session store.
//!
//! Separate from `SessionStore` because ACP is an externally-defined
//! standard that will drift from the format we chose for ourselves, and
//! because an editor's thread list should not be showing Matrix
//! conversations. The directory-walking machinery is shared; the line
//! format is not.
//!
//! Every event carries a UUIDv7 `id` and the `parent` it was appended
//! after. That pair cannot be reconstructed later, which is why it is
//! here now even though nothing reads it yet: it is what will make an
//! offline divergence detectable if remote-workspace sync is ever
//! implemented, and what makes splitting one file per event a
//! mechanical move rather than a redesign.
//!
//! **The chain is the authority on order, not the id's timestamp.**
//! UUIDv7 embeds the writer's clock, so two devices with skewed clocks
//! produce ids that sort wrongly against each other.

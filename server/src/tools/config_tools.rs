//! The agent's own definition files, as tools (#265).
//!
//! `<workspace>/heartbeat/*.md`, `<workspace>/autonomous/*.md` and
//! `<workspace>/agents/*.md` are the files an operator hand-edits to
//! describe work the agent does on its own. One `ConfigTool`, registered
//! three times with only the directory differing, is what lets a chat
//! room read and write them.
//!
//! Two properties hold the design together:
//!
//! - **A room profile must be named.** `[tools.admin].room_profiles` is a
//!   host-layer list of room-profile names, and every action refuses in a
//!   session whose profile is not on it. A channel room resolves to its
//!   profile the same way its provider does; an ACP session carries the
//!   profile its bearer token pinned at `session/new` (or `load`/`resume`),
//!   which is what lets an editor manage definitions at all — ACP has no
//!   room id. The transports that name no profile (`/rpc`, A2A, voice, the
//!   unattended loops) get `None`, which is a refusal.
//! - **The write side refuses what the loader would drop.** `parse_definition`
//!   is the loader's own parse, failing instead of skipping, so a
//!   definition that would never fire cannot be written and then puzzled
//!   over.

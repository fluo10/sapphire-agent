//!
//! A tool's `execute` takes only its JSON input — it has no idea which
//! session called it, and the ACP connection lives per-connection in
//! `serve::acp`. Threading a session through `Tool` would touch every
//! tool for the benefit of six, so the handle is carried in a
//! `tokio::task_local` scoped around tool execution instead.
//!
//! `src/timer.rs` solves the same problem the same way: the turn loops
//! wrap `tools.execute(...)` in `scope_timer_origin` so the timer tool
//! can read where its call came from.
//!
//! This is a trait rather than the SDK's connection type so the tools

//! `skill`: load a written procedure — planning, TDD, debugging, code
//! review, finishing a branch — from the checkout on the editor's
//! machine that `crate::skills` resolves and indexes.
//!
//! Two things make this different from the other `client_*` tools:
//!
//! 1. **There is no ACP call to list a directory.** `create_terminal`
//!    is the only way to ask the editor's machine anything about its
//!    filesystem shape, so resolving and indexing the skills directory
//!    always goes through a shell script (`crate::skills::RESOLVE_AND_INDEX_SH`)
//!    run over `client_exec::run_client_command`, never `fs/read_text_file`.
//! 2. **Reading one skill's body prefers `fs/read_text_file` and falls
//!    back to the terminal.** An editor may scope `fs/read_text_file`
//!    to the open project, and the skills checkout is deliberately
//!    outside it — so the fallback (`cat` over the terminal) is the
//!    path expected to run in practice, not defensive padding.
//!
//! The resolved index is cached per session (see [`SkillTool::cache`]'s
//! doc) so a session's second and later `skill()` calls don't re-run
//! the resolver script.

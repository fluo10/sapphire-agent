/// Resolve the skills directory for writing: the first candidate that

/// (`resolve_or_create_dir`, shared by `skill_install`, `skill_update`
/// and `skill_uninstall`) are both being asked "where is the skills
/// directory," just for different purposes. Only when *none* of the
/// four candidates exists does this fall back to a second pass that
/// creates the first *eligible* one — base variable set, existence not
/// required — in the same order.
///
/// Earlier, this script picked its candidate on eligibility alone (base
/// variable set, no existence test), which could disagree with
/// `RESOLVE_AND_INDEX_SH` about where an already-populated checkout
/// lives: `$APPDATA` set but `%APPDATA%\sapphire-agent\skills` never
/// created, with a real, hand-made checkout sitting under the XDG
/// candidate instead, used to make this script `mkdir -p` a second,
/// empty directory under `%APPDATA%` and use *that* — silently
/// orphaning the real checkout from every mutating tool while `skill()`
/// kept listing it from the XDG path.
///
/// The macOS branch requires `HOME` to be non-empty *before* testing
/// `-d`, in both passes. Without that guard, an unset `HOME` collapses
/// the test to `-d "/Library/Application Support"` — a directory that
/// exists on every real macOS install regardless of `HOME` — so a
/// client spawned without `HOME` (a service, a stripped-down
/// environment) could still match it and silently create under a
/// system-wide path instead of falling through to the XDG-based
/// candidate below.
///
/// **What a typo'd `$SAPPHIRE_AGENT_SKILLS_DIR` does now:** nothing
/// special. It is tested for existence in the same first pass as every
/// other candidate, so a typo that points nowhere is simply skipped in
/// favor of whichever real candidate already has a directory — the same
/// outcome `RESOLVE_AND_INDEX_SH` reaches for `skill()`. Only if *no*
/// candidate exists anywhere does the override win the creation pass,
/// same as before: it is the one variable whose entire purpose is "use
